CommonJS Utils is a collection of various CommonJS modules. Modules include:

# extend-error
This module returns a factory for creating custom Error constructors. The extend-error 
export is a function:

* ErrorConstructor(name, superError) - Creates a new error constructor. For example:

    MyError = require("commonjs-utils/extend-error")("MyError", Error);
    ...
    throw new MyError("something went wrong");  

# json-ext
This module allows for JSON-style parsing with additional JavaScript constructs like
undefined, NaN, Infinity, and dates. The following functions are exported:

* parse(str) - Parse the provided JSON-style object, array, or primitive literal string.
* stringify(value) - Encodes the provided value as a JSON-style object, array, or primitive literal.

# base64 
Provides conversion between JavaScript strings and base64. The base64 module exports:

* encode(str) - Encode the provided string in base64
* decode(base64) - Decode a base64 string to a normal string
